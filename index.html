                <h3>Childhood</h3>
                <figure>
                    <p>I was boyish. I have a lot of boy friends. We sneak a lot of time and hang out at the river. I was studying
                        at our local school and wasn't a good student. All i have in mind back then was to enjoy myself playing on any
                        kind of game we can think of.

                    <p>
                        It was during my teenage year that I learned to value our lessons at school. I was insipired to study well as 
                        my mind is becoming aware that I have to because of our status at home. In this stage of life also, I realized that 
                        there is more to life than games and temporary happiness. I am blessed to encounter the Lord.
                        The maker and finisher of my life story.

                    <p>
                        As I am getting older, I encounter a lot of lessons in life. And the most important of them all is the fact that
                        you don't need to dwell on your failures and mistakes but rather embrace it and to learn from it. Also, I realized
                        that we need to love our parents even more because as our age is gettig older so it is on them.</p>
